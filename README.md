# Covid-Forecasting-using-deep-learning
# About the project
This is the repository of Covid forecasting using deep learning methods:The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 650 million cases as of 23 December 2022, making it one of the worst in history. Forecasting the future number of cases based on current status is crucial for healthcare infrastructure preparedness. Many deep-learning models have been developed to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases using CNN, LSTM, or a combination of both, however, their accuracy can be further improved. Here, in this paper, we developed a transformer model to predict COVID-19 cases for Brazil, India, and Russia with improvement in prediction accuracy compared to other deep learning methods. Although our models have only been used to forecast cases in these three countries, they can easily be applied to datasets from other countries. When compared to some existing models, the transformer model has the best forecasting performance and shows an improvement in forecasting accuracy. Our model will allow for more accurate forecasting of COVID-19 cases and will aid in the global fight against the pandemic. 

# Datasets
The data used for the research is under the Datasets folder. It contains the data for the three countries(India,Russia,Brazil) the models were trained on.
